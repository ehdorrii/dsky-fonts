3.  DESIGN

    A.  MATERIAL:  ACRYLIC PER MIL-P-5425, FINISH A.
	
	B.  FINISH:  BACKGROUND SHALL BE TT-E-527 BLACK LUSTERLESS ENAMEL OR EPOXY
	    COLOR NO. 37038 PER FED-STD-595.  CHARACTERS, NON-
		ILLUMINATED, TO APPEAR WHITE COLOR NO. 37875 PER FED-STD-595.
		
	C.  MARKINGS: PER TABLE 1 SHALL BE GORTON NORMAL WITH
	    1. PROPORTIONS PER ND 1002122 TYPE II, CLASS 1 EXCEPT AS NOTED:
		   a)  CHARACTER HEIGHT TO BE MEASURED AS OVERALL HEIGHT.
		   b)  LINE STROKE WIDTH TO BE .030 FOR .250 HIGH CHARACTERS.
		   c)  LINE STROKE WIDTH TO BE .022 FOR .125 HIGH CHARACTERS.
		   
		2. FUTURA DEMIBOLD MARKINGS PER ND 1002122 SHALL ALSO BE ACCEPTABLE. THESE SHALL BE MODIFIED
		   TO HAVE STROKE WIDTHS AS IN 3C1.
		   
	D.  COLOR:  WHEN BACKLIGHTED PER 2C, COLOR SHALL BE WHITE, WITH COLOR COORDINATES
	    X = .330 +/- .030, Y = .330 +/- .030, PER CIE CHROMACITY DIAGRAM.
		
	E:  CONTRAST:  WHITE COLOR IN 3B MAY BE REDUCED IN SATURATION PROVIDED A MINIMUM CONTRAST OF 5 UNITS
	    BETWEEN BLACK BACKGROUND AND UNLIGHTED CHARACTER WHEN MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH MIL-P-7788.
		FOR CONTRAST MEASUREMENT THE CAP MAY BE BACKED WITH AN EL LAMP PER
		SCD 1006340 SPACED 0.2 INCHES AWAY.

From my own observation:

The legends on the keycaps are Gorton Normal.
The legends on the annunciator display are Gorton Condensed, except...
For the J-series LM DSKYs, the two additional annunciator labels (PRIO DISP and NO DAP) are in are Futura Demibold.
The legends in the digital display ("COMP ACTY" "PROG" "VERB" "NOUN") are Futura Demibold.
